I have co-led and developed impactful projects like 'Silah' for translating sign language letters and 'EduEye' for predicting at-risk students and identifying gifted ones. I also developed 'Velorent' for personal car rentals and was part of the 'Yusra' project team to facilitate access for people with disabilities. My team and I won second place in the Qualithon hackathon among 63 teams from 30 universities. I also secured first place for three consecutive years at the university's Scientific Forum in the 'Distinguished Entrepreneurial Idea' track. I am a graduate of Apple's AI Foundation Camp and Samsung's AI program. I hold a Global Leadership certificate from Coventry University in the UK after being selected among the top 16 students at the university. I also won first place in the Youth Initiatives Hackathon across the Kingdom with the 'Tawq' project to make volunteer hours a university competition. These achievements have enhanced my skills in leadership, innovation, and quality, and I strive to leverage technology to create inspiring, real-world solutions.",
